	Short: "A cross-platform command-line interface for cloud file storage and management",
	Long: `Nimbus CLI provides a hierarchical file organization system with direct S3 storage.

Files are organized in a simple structure:
- Boxes → Top-level containers (e.g., "work", "school", "photos")
- Folders → Hierarchical directories within a box
- Files → Individual files stored in S3

Current MVP commands:
  nimbus post --file ./document.pdf    Upload a file to S3
  nimbus get --file <s3-key> -o ./doc  Download a file from S3

Visit https://github.com/your-org/nim-cli for more information.`,
